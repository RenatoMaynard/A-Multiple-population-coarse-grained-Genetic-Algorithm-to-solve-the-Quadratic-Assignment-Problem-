# Genetic Algorithm (GA) Implementations for the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP)

## Overview
This repository contains two implementations of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for solving the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP):

1. **GA implemented in C**: A sequential version of the Genetic Algorithm designed to run on CPU.
2. **GA implemented in CUDA**: A parallelized version of the Genetic Algorithm GPU for improved computational performance, developed using the paper ["Solving Quadratic Assignment Problems by Genetic
Algorithms with GPU Computation: A Case Study"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1570256.1570355) as a reference.
3. **Mathematical Model in Jupyter Notebook**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the mathematical model to solve the QAP.
